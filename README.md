hi my name is valerie, currently using windows and soon-to-be on endeavorOS, you can make all the jokes about me not being on actual arch linux but i dont care.

outside of that, i dont have much to mention about myself outside of that i like glitch production shows, mainly murder drones by liam vickers, i think the story is pretty cool

im also from stockholm, so i guess thats cool

ok bai
